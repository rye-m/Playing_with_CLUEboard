## Deliverables
1. Assignment writeup: prepare a short 500~750 word description of your telltale. Describe the location where it is meant to exist, and the information that it aims to display. Describe how you got the information — sensors on the device, or connectivity with another device — and any additional processing you did to the data to get to the displayed information. 

2. Photo or video of the working device: Document the telltale, preferably in its environment, displaying the information you set out to display. For a static display of a value that does not change often, a photograph is sufficient, but a video may also make sense depending on what you've built. You can choose either medium. 

3. Code: Upload your code.py file, and any other resources (fonts, bitmaps) that we would need to evaluate your work.
